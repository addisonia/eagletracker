Welcome to EagleTracker!

This webapp is designed for users to log points for when they spot bald eagles. Simple click/tap the "Add an Eagle" button to set a point down on the map. 

You can pick from 3 different basemaps for display purposes. 

If you'd like to change the title and/or notes for a point after a submission, click/tap on the point and then click/tap the edit button. You can also delete an entry with the delete button.

Using the search bar, you can zoom your location to a place (like a city, town, etc.) or a point that you logged (based off the name you gave it).

Have fun!
